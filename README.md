# lunarvim-docker
a docker-ized lunar-vim (WIP)

### not afilliated with the main project
https://www.lunarvim.org/

pre-reqs:
- docker
- make

how to build and run:
- clone repo and run make build or make build-and-run

or

- docker run -it gigatexal/lunarvim:latest

limitations:
- one has to pass volumes or map directories in to edit files
- this was sort of a proof of concept on my end to get familiar with lunarvim
